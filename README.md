## Create DAX 
Define some important KPIs which will be shown in the dashboard and use DAX to create measures in each table.
The kPI contains adjust price, return rate, 10-day rolling profit, 90-day rolling profit, and so on.

# lesson learn
- Communicate with the business department to define KPIs needed in the dashboard. Apart from that, cooperate with them to test if the dashboard is user-friendly for clients.
- Considering the performance of the dashboard, I create Measures in the tables to calculate KPIs using DAX functions, instead of adding columns.
- Add useful bookmarks to link the different pages. In this way, all pages of the dashboard can work together and can show both summary and details in a short time.
